# Python

## Why?

- Strengthen good practices.
- Easy to learn.
- Elegant (defined structure).
- Readable: intuitive and strict syntax.
- Productive: saves a lot of code.
- Portable: for all operating systems.
- Reloaded: it comes with many libraries by default.

## Zen

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Virtualenvs

Using venv module:

    python3 -m venv venv

## Learned

### Data types

- Integers, booleans, strings, lists, dictionaries and tuples.

- Remember that in Python everything is an object.

- The advantage of tuples over lists is that going through a for loop is much faster with tuples.

`lista = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

`tupla = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`

### Comments

- A single hashtag for inline comment or block code between triple quote.

### Another

- Variables (unlike other programming languages) you should not define them, nor their data type, since at the time of iterating them their type will be identified.

- Read tracebacks from final to start.

- How you can open a file?

`R -> reading`

`W -> writing - overwrite`

`A -> writing - append`

- How to print functions for an object?

`dir([5, 2, 1])`

- How to generate a range in a list?

`list(range(5))`

- How to add elements in a list?

`sum([1, 2, 4])`

- Print information about a function or library

`help(sorted)`

i.e. **is** is used to compare values, **==** is used to compare objects.
