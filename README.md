# Python

## Why?

- Strengthen good practices.
- Easy to learn.
- Elegant (defined structure).
- Readable: intuitive and strict syntax.
- Productive: saves a lot of code.
- Portable: for all operating systems.
- Reloaded: it comes with many libraries by default.

## Zen

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

## Virtualenvs

Using venv module:

    python3 -m venv venv

## Learned

- The advantage of tuples over lists is that going through a for loop is much faster with tuples.

`lista = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

`tupla = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`

- Read tracebacks from final to start.

- You can debugging without VS Code with python<3.7 you can use:

`import pdb`

`pdb.set_trace()`

- You can debugging without VS Code with python>=3.7 you can use:

`breakpoint()`

- How you can open a file?

`R -> reading`

`W -> writing - overwrite`

`A -> writing - append`

# Read about python in web

- [Official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) includes the python standard library, the python language reference... and more!

- [Style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) gives coding conventions for the Python code.
